## xDD Document Linking

A simple interface for linking terms in unstructured data by harnessing the power of xDD.

## Development workflow

This app is built using React and Next.js, a Javascript web framework that allows
relatively simple server-side rendering. A mix of JSX and "hyperscript" semantics
are used for element trees. Typescript is used for editor integrations, but typings
are not complete and errors are swallowed.

[Macrostrat UI components](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/ui-components) are
used heavily for basic UI primitives (e.g. the infinite scrolling view).

1. `npm install` (submodule dependencies should also be installed by this step
   using a preinstall hook).
2. `npm run dev` will run the Next.JS dev server for the main codebase. It will
   also run compilation for the UI Component modules in the background. Unfortunately,
   the UI Components produce a lot of typescript errors on compilation, but these
   can be safely ignored.
3. The website should be available on `http://localhost:3000` or similar.
